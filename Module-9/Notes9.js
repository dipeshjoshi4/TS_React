//!116 Lecture-1-Understanding React Lifecycle Methods: Class vs Functional Components

/*
- In this lecture we have covered React lifecycle methods. 
- We’ve explored how they work in class components with good use cases, and also how to achieve the same in functional components.
- React’s lifecycle is really crucial—it's the foundation of how React works. 
- We’ve broken down 
        ?- mounting,
        ?- unmounting,
        ?- re-rendering in detail,
- so you’ll understand exactly how the React lifecycle works in practice. By the end of this lecture, you’ll have full clarity on the topic.
