//!124 Lecture-9-PART-1-useReducer():Alternative to useState for Complex Logic-

/*
In this lecture, we covered the useReducer hook, which you can think of as a simpler version of Redux. It helps you manage more complex state logic in your project. We started with a very basic example so you can get familiar with the syntax and understand how it works. In the next lecture, we'll dive into more complex structures, but for now, youâ€™ll get a solid idea of how to implement useReducer in your own projects.
