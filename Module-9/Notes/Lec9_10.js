//!124 Lecture-9-PART-1-useReducer():Alternative to useState for Complex Logic-

/*
In this lecture, we covered the useReducer hook, which you can think of as a simpler version of Redux.
It helps you manage more complex state logic in your project.
We started with a very basic example so you can get familiar with the syntax and understand how it works.
In the next lecture(PART-2), we'll dive into more complex structures, but for now, youâ€™ll get a solid idea of how to implement useReducer in your own projects.
