//!126 Lec11-useMemo() – Performance Optimization

//In this lecture, we talked about how to use the useMemo hook in React. 
//We explained how you can memoize a value so that expensive calculations don’t slow down other state updates. 
//We used a clear example to show how useMemo helps in preventing unnecessary recalculations. We also discussed the difference between useMemo and useEffect, and when to use each one.
