//?85 Lecture-1-Introduction to React Routing : Setting Up Your Project


/*
* Lecture Summary

- So, in this lecture, I'm going to explain the importance of React Routing—why it's a crucial feature in React and how it can really benefit you.Essentially, we’ll look at how you can integrate React Routing into an existing codebase. I've put together a bit of a boilerplate code to help you understand how to approach an existing codebase and then add React Routing on top of it. We’ve also done a bit of refinement and added some CSS just to give you a feel for how it all fits together. And that’s it for this lecture. In the next one, we'll dive deeper into more concepts around React Routing.
