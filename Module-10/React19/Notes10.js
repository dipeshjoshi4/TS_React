//!133-lecture-1-React 19 Introduction: useActionState() â€“ Modern Form & State Handling

/*
- In this lecture, we learned about the new useActionState hook introduced in React 19. 
- This hook makes form handling much easier and more efficient. Instead of creating separate states for data, errors, and loading, useActionState lets you manage everything in a simpler way.
- It reduces the amount of code, keeps it more readable, and helps in handling complex forms effectively. 
- React 19 introduces this hook as part of its focus on improving form management and working with complex data.
