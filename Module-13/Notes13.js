//!185-Lec-1-Mastering Webpack: The Power of Module Bundling for Real-World Web Apps
//- In this lecture, we've explored what Webpack is and how it's used in real-world web applications.
//- Essentially, Webpack is a module bundler that takes all your JavaScript files and bundles them into a single file.
//- This process helps optimize performance and is especially useful for large-scale applications in major companies.


// You can understand webpack with this image => Source => https://webpack.js.org/
//- so webpack basically turns your many files into 1 or you can have all control and make a configuration if you dont want a one file in that single file you can make seprate file

//- example i have 3 js files have became 1 but i have to seprate my moment js library in different part which is use for date and time or u have to seprate your 3d ui threejs in different style the u can seprate

// we have other bunmdlers to like rollup and parcel but they have all configuration built in......we can thave all access within our hand
