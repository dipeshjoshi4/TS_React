# Problem Statement

- Create a simple React progress bar that:
- Starts from 0% to 100% when the Start button is clicked.
- Always resets back to 0% every time Start is clicked.
- Uses useState to store the progress value.
- Uses useEffect + setTimeout to gradually increase the progress.
- Automatically stops when it reaches 100%.
