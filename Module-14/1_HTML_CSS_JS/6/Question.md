**Problem Statement**

**Implement a Basic To-Do List**

**Problem Statement:**
Using HTML and Vanilla JavaScript, implement a simple To-Do List application that performs the following tasks:

1. Create an input field where the user can type a task.
2. Add a button labelled “Add” that, when clicked, adds the entered text as a new list item below the input field.
3. Each list item (`<li>`) should include the task text and a “Delete” button next to it.
4. When the “Delete” button is clicked, *only that particular task* should be removed from the list.
5. After adding a task, the input box should be cleared automatically.

**Constraints:**

* Use only Vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries or frameworks).
* Use DOM methods like `createElement` and so on.
* Do not use `innerHTML` for inserting elements.
* Inline event handlers (like `onclick`) are allowed for this task.
