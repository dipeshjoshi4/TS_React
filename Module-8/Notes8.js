//?111 Lecture-2-Part 1: Mastering Container Components in React

/*
- In this lecture, we covered the concept of container and the presentational design pattern in React.
- We explored how containers manage state and pass it down as props to presentational (or "dumb") components, which are focused solely on rendering the UI.
- This is a widely used design pattern, especially in large-scale projects, to maintain clean and manageable code.

? we make 2 Component
1-> Containers ->UserContainers.jsx => Which Work as Smart Component
2-> Components ->UserList.jsx => Which Work as Dumb Component

?CODE => UserContainers.jsx

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
const UserContainers = () => {
    const [users, setUsers] = useState([])
    const [errors, setErrors] = useState(false)
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
    const getUser = async () => {
        try {
            setIsLoading(true);
            const response = await fetch('https://reqres.in/api/users', {
                headers: {
                    'x-api-key': 'reqres-free-v1'
                }
            })
            const json = await response.json();
            console.log(json)
            if (!json.data) return;
            setUsers(json.data)
            setIsLoading(false)
        } catch (errors) {
            setErrors(errors);
            console.log(errors)
        }
    }
    useEffect(() => {
        getUser()
    }, [])
    return (
        <div>

        </div>
    )
}
export default UserContainers

?Code Explaination

- WE HAVE TO make data ain userContainer.jsx and show on UserList.jsx
- so here we make a data api which we get from  => https://app.reqres.in/  => We get User Api

?CODE Structure
- so untill data comes loading then comes then users and if not comes then Errors
- So 3 state for the data
- one function to get Data from users  => we use getUser()
- here we write logic part of async await with in try catch  to get data from api

- in last we use useEffect Hook . Why  Because we need to refresh page when data came to for that
useEffect(() =>
    {getUser()
},[])

?Result
- we get data on console
- now we have to pass as props in UserList.jsx

?Theory Some  To undertsand this design part

?1.Container Component = "Smart"
- Hnadles All Logic of that Component  if users then users(state API,DATA FECTHING,side Effects) what data send to the UI

?2.Presentation Component = "Dumb"
- Only responsible for displaying the UI
- recevies data via props from the container
- No Logic,Just Presentation

? benefits

- Reusable Components
- Easier To Maintain
- Simpler to Test

? Drawbacks

- slight overhead for many smaller scale app
- can be tricky for beginner to understand
- May Lead to Prop Drilling(Passing data through multiple components levels)

//?113 Lecture-4-Mastering Custom Hooks Design Pattern : Simplify Your Code Reusability

/*
- In this lecture, we covered the Custom Hook design pattern, a powerful approach commonly used in large codebase applications.
- We explored how to create your own custom hooks to encapsulate logic once and reuse it anywhere you need. By doing so, you can avoid repetitive code and streamline your components. 
- This lecture will help you understand the practical use of custom hooks and how they make your React code more maintainable and efficient.


?Custom Hook Design Pattern

- logic and fetching data function into hooks 

?hooks -> useFetch.js

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
export const useFetch = () => {
    const [users, setUsers] = useState([])
    const [errors, setErrors] = useState(false)
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
    const getUser = async () => {
        try {
            setIsLoading(true);
            const response = await fetch('https://reqres.in/api/users', {
                headers: {
                    'x-api-key': 'reqres-free-v1'
                }
            })
            const json = await response.json();
            console.log(json)
            if (!json.data) return;
            setUsers(json.data)
            setIsLoading(false)
        } catch (errors) {
            setErrors(errors);
            console.log(errors)
        }
    }
    useEffect(() => {
        getUser()
    }, [])
    return { users, errors, isLoading }
}
export default useFetch

?UserContainer.jsx

import UserList from "../Components/UserList"
import useFetch from '../hooks/useFetch'
const UserContainers = () => {
    const { users, errors, isLoading } = useFetch()
    return (
        <div>
            <UserList users={users} Loading={isLoading} error={errors} />
        </div>
    )
}
export default UserContainers



?2nd Example



?useWindowSize.js

import React from 'react'
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export const useWindowSize = () => {
    const [size, setSize] = useState({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
    })

    useEffect(() => {
        const handleResize = () => {
            setSize({
                width: window.innerWidth,
                height: window.innerHeight,
            })
        };
        window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize)
        return (()=>window.removeEventListener("resize",handleResize))
    }, [])
    return size;
}

export default useWindowSize

? App.jsx
import UserContainers from "./containers/UserContainers"
import useWindowSize from "./hooks/useWindowSize"
function App() {
  const { width, height } = useWindowSize()
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Conatiner Presentation Design Pattern</h1>
      <UserContainers />
      <div>
        window Size : {height} * {width};
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
export default App

?useEffect() Why Need Here in this solution!

   ❌ Calling it directly
  getUser();

getUser() runs on the first render → sets state with setUsers.Setting state causes React to re-render.On re-render, getUser() 
runs again → sets state again → another re-render.
🔁 Infinite loop of re-renders & API calls.
✅ Why useEffect solves this
When you do:

useEffect(() => {
  getUser();
}, []);

React delays the call until after the first render is done.With [] (empty dependency array),
it only runs once when the component mounts.No infinite loop, no repeated API calls.

🧠 Key idea
Component body = render logic only (pure function of props/state → UI).
useEffect = side effects (API calls, subscriptions, timers, logging).
That’s why in design patterns:
The Container or Custom Hook puts side effects in useEffect.
The Presentational component stays pure (no side effects).

👉 Think of it like this:
Render = “What should I show right now?”
Effect = “What should I do after showing it?”

?useEffect(()=>{
      return 
},[])
//? in useEfect whatever you return its a clean up function



?--------------------------Thory OF Custom Hook Design Pattern----------------------

- A custom hook is a resuable function the use react built in Hooks to capture and reuse  any logic across components

?# pros 
- Reusability : Build once,use multiple times,Avoid Rewriting the same data-fetching or logic repeatedly
- Cleaner Code :keeps components code simple and clean by moving complex logic into the hook
- Testing & Maintenanace: Easier to test and maintain since the logic is isolated

?#Cons 
- Learning Curve : Beginners might find it tricky at first to decide when and how to create custom hooks
- overhead for small apps : May Be Unnecessary overhead for very small applications

//?114 Lecture-5-Enhancing Components with Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

/*
- In this lecture, we delved into the Higher-Order Component (HOC) design pattern. 
- We explained how HOCs work by taking an existing component and returning a new component with enhanced functionality.
- We used a user authentication scenario as a real-world example for demo how you can wrap components with HOCs to add extra behavior. 
- This lecture will give you a clear understanding of how to leverage HOCs to make your React components more modular and reusable.

? Higher Order Component Design Pattern :-
- Are basically  components that take another component as input,add some  extra functionality to it, and then return a new enhanced 
Component

?as for the pros
- improve code reusability,sepration of concerns and overall readability

?as for the cons
- they can sometimes lead to a bit of reduced performance and add some complexity in debugging


- if in our website there is user page and dashboard page .
- then we gave that component to HOC and HOC Handle That Authentic Layer to is it qualified for access that particular page or not


?UserAuth.jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"

const UserAuth = (WrapperComponent) => {

  const AuthWrapper = (props) => {   //instead of return = (props) => {} => just to rid of warning of useEffect cant use in callback

    console.log(WrapperComponent) //for just rid of warning 

    const navigate = useNavigate()
    const isAuth = true

    useEffect(() => {
      console.log("User Authentication", isAuth)
      if (!isAuth) {
        navigate("/")

      }
    }, [isAuth, navigate])

    return isAuth ? <WrapperComponent {...props} hoc="hocValue" /> : null

  }
  return AuthWrapper
}

export default UserAuth
