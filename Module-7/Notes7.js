//?97 Lecture-1-Frontend & Backend Collaboration: API & Error Handling

- In this lecture, I’ve discussed how a frontend developer collaborates with the backend team.
- We talked about the roles and responsibilities on both sides—what the frontend handles and what the backend team is responsible for.
- Since this module is all about API integration and error handling, naturally we’re covering how frontend and backend developers work together. I’ve tried to give you a sense of how this collaboration looks in a company and what we’re going to cover in this module.
