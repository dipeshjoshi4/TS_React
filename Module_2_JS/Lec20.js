//!Event Delegation for Performance Optimization & Event Bubbling


//?Event Bubbling in JavaScript

// - event flows from its target element to its parent

// ● Events in JavaScript propagate from child to parent(bottom to top).
// ● When an event is triggered on a child element, it bubbles up through its ancestors unless stopped.
// ● This allows parent elements to listen for events fired on their descendant elements.
// ● Example: Clicking a button inside a < div > can also trigger a click event on the < div >.


//? Event Delegation

// - parent elements handles child events efficiently

// ● Technique where a parent element handles events for its child elements.
// ● Useful when:
    // ○ You have many child elements.
    // ○ Elements are dynamically added or removed.
// ● Instead of attaching event listeners to each child, attach one listener to the parent.
// ● Use event.target to determine which child triggered the event.
// ● Improves performance and maintainability.
