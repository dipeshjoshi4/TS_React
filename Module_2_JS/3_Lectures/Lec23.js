//- Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up function execution by caching the results of expensive function calls and reusing the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

//? How It Works:
// A memoized function stores the results of previous computations in a cache(often an object or a map).
// When the function is called with the same arguments, it first checks the cache.
// If the result is already in the cache, it returns the cached result instead of recomputing it.

//? Use Case:
//- Memoization is particularly useful for functions with heavy computations or recursive functions like those used in calculating Fibonacci numbers
